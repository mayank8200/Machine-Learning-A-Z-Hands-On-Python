# Machine-Learning-A-Z-Hands-On-Python
# Description
Interested in the field of Machine Learning? Then this course is for you!

This course has been designed by two professional Data Scientists so that we can share our knowledge and help you learn complex theory, algorithms and coding libraries in a simple way.

We will walk you step-by-step into the World of Machine Learning. With every tutorial you will develop new skills and improve your understanding of this challenging yet lucrative sub-field of Data Science.

This course is fun and exciting, but at the same time we dive deep into Machine Learning. It is structured the following way:

Part 1 - Data Preprocessing
Part 2 - Regression: Simple Linear Regression, Multiple Linear Regression, Polynomial Regression, SVR, Decision Tree Regression, Random Forest Regression
Part 3 - Classification: Logistic Regression, K-NN, SVM, Kernel SVM, Naive Bayes, Decision Tree Classification, Random Forest Classification
Part 4 - Clustering: K-Means, Hierarchical Clustering
Part 5 - Association Rule Learning: Apriori, Eclat
Part 6 - Reinforcement Learning: Upper Confidence Bound, Thompson Sampling
Part 7 - Natural Language Processing: Bag-of-words model and algorithms for NLP
Part 8 - Deep Learning: Artificial Neural Networks, Convolutional Neural Networks
Part 9 - Dimensionality Reduction: PCA, LDA, Kernel PCA
Part 10 - Model Selection & Boosting: k-fold Cross Validation, Parameter Tuning, Grid Search, XGBoost


This repo is a basic implementation of Machine Learning consisting of Data Preprocessing, Regression and Classification problems.
Each folder contains implementation of each algorithm that belongs to their type of problem.
Scikit-Learn library is used to implement the algorithms
Each file is well structured containing comments for better explanation.
Datasets are also provided
